# Strivers-SDE-Sheet

This repository serves as a record of progress for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem-solving based on the Striver's Sheet, organized in a daily topic-wise format.

## Overview

The Striver's Sheet is a popular resource for those preparing for software development/engineering interviews, particularly focusing on DSA. This repository contains solutions to various problems from the sheet, categorized by day and topic.

## Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day corresponding to a specific DSA topic. Inside each day's folder, you'll find solutions to problems related to that topic. For example:

```
Day 1 (Arrays)/
    |- next-permutation.cpp
    |- best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.cpp
    |- ...
```
